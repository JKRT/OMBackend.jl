#=
The current scheme for structural change.
Callbacks are created in the model that encompasses the two submodels.

These callbacks contains a boolean field that indicate if the structure has changed.
It also contains a field indicating what system we should switch to.

During solving, this field is set by the callback.
In the solver loop we iterate through these callbacks.

If a structural change was detected we act on it and change to the system pointed to by the callback.
Depending on the encompassing system we either just in time recompile the new system or we switch to the new.
Saving our current time step and reinitialize our new changed system.

We should also statically detect if VSS simulation is needed since it is more resource heavy than regular simulation
